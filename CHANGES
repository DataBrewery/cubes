Changes in the Cubes
====================

0.10.1
======

Quick Summary:

* added presenters

New Features
------------

* added `create_server(config_path)` to simplify wsgi script
* added `dimension_schema` option to star browser – use this when you have
  all dimensions grouped in a separate schema than fact table 
* added `HierarchyError`
* added presenters: simple_html_table, simple_data_table, text_table
* added create_presenter(presenter_type, options ...)
* AggregationResult.levels is a new dictionary containing levels that the
  result was drilled down to. Keys are dimension names, values are levels.
* AggregationResult.table_rows() output has a new variable `is_base` to denote
  whether the row is base or not in regard to table_rows dimension.

* added sql worskspace functions:
  * create_conformed_rollup()
  * create_conformed_rollups()
  * create_cube_aggregate()

Changes
-------

* Changed string representation of a set cut: now using semicolon ';' as a
  separator instead of a plus symbol '+'
* aggregation browser subclasses should now fill result's `levels` variable
  with `coalesced_drilldown()` output for requested drill-down levels.
* Moved coalesce_drilldown() from star browser to cubes.browser module to be
  reusable by other browsers. Method might be renamed in the future.

Fixes
-----

* fixed ordering bug
* `AggregationResult.table_rows` now works when there is no point cut
* get correct reference in `table_rows` – now works when simple denormalized
  table is used 

0.10
====

Quick Summary
-------------

* Dimension defition can have a "template". For example:

  {
      "name": "contract_date",
      "template": "date"
  }
* added table_rows() and cross_table()
* added simple_model(cube_name, dimension_names, measures)

*Incompatibilities:*  use `create_model()` instead of `Model(**dict)`, if you
  were using just `load_model()`, you are fine.

New Features
------------

* To address issue #8 create_model(dict) was added as replacement for
  Model(**dict). Model() from now on will expect correctly constructed model
  objects. `create_model()` will be able to handle various simplifications and
  defaults during the construction process.
* added `info` attribute to all model objects. It can be used to store custom,
  application or front-end specific information
* preliminary implementation of `cross_table()` (interface might be changed)
* `AggregationResult.table_rows()` - new method that iterates through
  drill-down rows and returns a tuple with key, label, path, and rest of the
  fields.
* dimension in model description can specify another template dimension – all
  properties from the template will be inherited in the new dimension. All
  dimension properties specified in the new dimension completely override the
  template specification
* added point_cut_for_dimension
* added simple_model(cube_name, dimensions, measures) – creates a single-cube
  model with flat dimensions from a list of dimension names and measures from
  a list of measure names. For example:

    `model = simple_model("contracts", ["year","contractor", "type"], ["amount"])`

*Slicer Server:*

* `/cell` – return cell details (replaces `/details`)

Changes
-------
* creation of a model from dictionary through Model(dict) is depreciated, use
  create_model(dict) instead. All initialization code will be moved there.
  Depreciation warnings were added. Old functionality retained for the time
  being. (**important**)
* Replaced Attribute.full_name() with Attribute.ref()
* Removed Dimension.attribute_reference() as same can be achieved with
  dim(attr).ref()
* AggregationResult.drilldown renamed to AggregationResults.cells

Planned Changes:

* str(Attribute) will return ref() instead of attribute name as it is more
  useful
  
Fixes
-----

* order of dimensions is now preserved in the Model

0.9.1
=====

**Summary**: Range cuts, denormalize with slicer tool, cells in `/report` query

New Features
------------

* cut_from_string(): added parsing of range and set cuts from string;
  introduced requirement for key format: Keys should now have format
  "alphanumeric character or underscore" if they are going to be converted to
  strings (for example when using slicer HTTP server)
* cut_from_dict(): create a cut (of appropriate class) from a dictionary
  description
* Dimension.attribute(name): get attribute instance from name
* added exceptions: CubesError, ModelInconsistencyError, NoSuchDimensionError,
  NoSuchAttributeError, ArgumentError, MappingError, WorkspaceError and
  BrowserError

*StarBrowser:*

* implemented RangeCut conditions

*Slicer Server:*

* `/report` JSON now accepts `cell` with full cell description as dictionary,
  overrides URL parameters

*Slicer tool:*

* `denormalize` option for (bulk) denormalization of cubes (see the the slicer
  documentation for more information)

Changes
-------

* all `/report` JSON requests should now have queries wrapped in the key
  `queries`. This was originally intended way of use, but was not correctly
  implemented. A descriptive error message is returned from the server if the
  key `queries` is not present. Despite being rather a bug-fix, it is listed
  here as it requires your attention for possible change of your code.
* warn when no backend is specified during slicer context creation

Fixes
-----

* Better handling of missing optional packages, also fixes #57 (now works
  without slqalchemy and without werkzeug as expected)
* see change above about `/report` and `queries`
* push more errors as JSON responses to the requestor, instead of just failing
  with an exception


Version 0.9
===========

Important Changes
-----------------

Summary of most important changes that might affect your code:

**Slicer**: Change all your slicer.ini configuration files to have [workspace]
section instead of old [db] or [backend]. Depreciation warning is issued, will
work if not changed.

**Model**: Change `dimensions` in `model` to be an array instead of a
dictionary. Same with `cubes`. Old style: `"dimensions" = { "date" = ... }`
new style: `"dimensions" = [ { "name": "date", ... } ]`. Will work if not
changed, just be prepared.

**Python**: Use Dimension.hierarchy() instead of Dimension.default_hierarchy.

New Features
------------

* slicer_context() - new method that holds all relevant information from 
  configuration. can be reused when creating tools that work in connected
  database environment
* added Hierarchy.all_attributes() and .key_attributes()
* Cell.rollup_dim() - rolls up single dimension to a specified level. this might
  later replace the Cell.rollup() method
* Cell.drilldown() - drills down the cell
* create_workspace() - new top-level method for creating a workspace by name
  of a backend and a configuration dictionary. Easier to create browsers (from
  possible browser pool) programmatically. The browser name might be full
  module name path or relative to the cubes.backends, for example
  `sql.browser` for default SQL denormalized browser.
* get_backend() - get backend by name

* AggregationBrowser.cell_details(): New method returning values of attributes
  representing the cell. Preliminary implementation, return value might
  change.
* AggregationBrowser.cut_details(): New method returning values of attributes
  representing a single cut. Preliminary implementation, return value might
  change.
  
* Dimension.validate() now checks whether there are duplicate attributes
* Cube.validate() now checks whether there are duplicate measures or details

SQL backend:

* new StarBrowser implemented:
    * StarBrowser supports snowflakes or denormalization (optional)
    * for snowflake browsing no write permission is required (does not have to
      be denormalized)
* new DenormalizedMapper for mapping logical model to denormalized view
* new SnowflakeMapper for mapping logical model to a snowflake schema
* ddl_for_model() - get schema DDL as string for model
* join finder and attribute mapper are now just Mapper - class responsible for
  finding appropriate joins and doing logical-to-physical mappings
* coalesce_attribute() - new method for coalescing multiple ways of describing
  a physical attribute (just attribute or table+schema+attribute)
* dimension argument was removed from all methods working with attributes
  (the dimension is now required attribute property)
* added create_denormalized_view() with options: materialize, create_index,
  keys_only
  
Slicer:

* slicer ddl - generate schema DDL from model
* slicer test - test configuration and model against database and report list 
  of issues, if any
  
* Backend options are now in [workspace], removed configurability of custom
  backend section. Warning are issued when old section names [db] and
  [backend] are used
 
* server responds to /details which is a result of
  AggregationBrowser.cell_details()

Examples:

* added simple Flask based web example - dimension aggregation browser

Changes
-------

* in Model: dimension and cube dictionary specification during model
  initialization is depreciated, list should be used (with explicitly
  mentioned attribute "name") -- **important**
* **important**: Now all attribute references in the model (dimension
  attributes, measures, ...) are required to be instances of Attribute() and
  the attribute knows it's dimension
* removed `hierarchy` argument from `Dimension.all_attributes()` and `.key_attributes()`
* renamed builder to denormalizer
* Dimension.default_hierarchy is now depreciated in favor of
  Dimension.hierarchy() which now accepts no arguments or argument None -
  returning default hierarchy in those two cases
* metadata are now reused for each browser within one workspace - speed
  improvement.

Fixes
-----

* Slicer version should be same version as Cubes: Original intention was to
  have separate server, therefore it had its own versioning. Now there is no
  reason for separate version, moreover it can introduce confusion.
* Proper use of database schema in the Mapper

Version 0.8
===========

New Features
------------

* Started writing StarBrowser - another SQL aggregation browser with different 
  approach (see code/docs)

Slicer Server:

* added configuration option `modules` under `[server]` to load additional 
  modules
* added ability to specify backend module
* backend configuration is in [backend] by default, for SQL it stays in [db]
* added server config option for default `prettyprint` value (useful for 
  demontration purposes)

Documentation:

* Changed license to MIT + small addition. Please refer to the LICENSE file.
* Updated documentation - added missing parts, made reference more readable, 
  moved class and function reference docs from descriptive part to reference 
  (API) part.
* added backend documentation 
* Added "Hello World!" example

Changed Features
----------------

* removed default SQL backend from the server
* moved worskpace creation into the backend module

Fixes
-----

* Fixed create_view to handle not materialized properly (thanks to deytao)
* Slicer tool header now contains #!/usr/bin/env python

Version 0.7.1
=============

Added tutorials in tutorials/ with models in tutorials/models/ and data in tutorials/data/:

* Tutorial 1: 
    * how to build a model programatically
    * how to create a model with flat dimensions
    * how to aggregate whole cube
    * how to drill-down and aggregate through a dimension
* Tutorial 2: 
    * how to create and use a model file
    * mappings
* Tutorial 3: 
    * how hierarhies work
    * drill-down through a hierarchy
* Tutorial 4 (not blogged about it yet):
    * how to launch slicer server
    
New Features
------------

* New method: Dimension.attribute_reference: returns full reference to an attribute
* str(cut) will now return constructed string representation of a cut as it can be used by Slicer

Slicer server:

* added /locales to slicer
* added locales key in /model request
* added Access-Control-Allow-Origin for JS/jQuery

Changes
-------

* Allow dimensions in cube to be a list, not only a dictionary (internally it is ordered dictionary)
* Allow cubes in model to be a list, not only a dictionary (internally it is ordered dictionary)

Slicer server:

* slicer does not require default cube to be specified: if no cube is in the request then try default from
  config or get first from model

Fixes
-----

* Slicer not serves right localization regardless of what localization was used first after server was
  launched (changed model localization copy to be deepcopy (as it should be))
* Fixes some remnants that used old Cell.foo based browsing to Browser.foo(cell, ...) only browsing 
* fixed model localization issues; once localized, original locale was not available
* Do not try to add locale if not specified. Fixes #11: https://github.com/Stiivi/cubes/issues/11

Version 0.7
===========

WARNING: Minor backward API incompatibility - Cuboid renamed to Cell. 

Changes
-------
* Class 'Cuboid' was renamed to more correct 'Cell'. 'Cuboid' is a part of cube with subset of
  dimensions.
* all APIs with 'cuboid' in their name/arguments were renamed to use 'cell' instead
* Changed initialization of model classes: Model, Cube, Dimension, Hierarchy, Level to be more "pythony":
  instead of using initialization dictionary, each attribute is listed as parameter, rest is handled from
  variable list of key word arguments
* Improved handling of flat and detail-less dimensions (dimensions represented just by one attribute which
  is also a key)

Model Initialization Defaults:

* If no levels are specified during initialization, then dimension name is considered flat, with single
attribute.
* If no hierarchy is specified and levels are specified, then default hierarchy will be created from order
of levels
* If no levels are specified, then one level is created, with name `default` and dimension will be
considered flat

Note: This initialization defaults might be moved into a separate utility function/class that will populate
incomplete model


New features
------------

Slicer server:
* changed to handle multiple cubes within model: you have to specify a cube for /aggregate, /facts,... in form: /cube/<cube_name>/<browser_action>
* reflect change in configuration: removed ``view``, added ``view_prefix`` and ``view_suffix``, the cube view name will be constructed by concatenating `view prefix` + `cube name` + `view suffix`
* in aggregate drill-down: explicit dimension can be specified with drilldown=dimension:level, such as:
  date:month

This change is considered final and therefore we can mark it is as API version 1.

Version 0.6
===========

New features
------------

Cubes:

* added 'details' to cube - attributes that might contain fact details which are not relevant to
  aggregation, but might be interesting when displaying facts
* added ordering of facts in aggregation browser
* SQL denormalizer can now add indexes to key columns, if requested
* one detail table can be used more than once in SQL denomralizer (such as an organisation for both -
  receiver and donor), added key ``alias`` to ``joins`` in model description

Slicer server:

* added ``log`` a and ``log_level`` configuration options (under ``[server]``)
* added ``format=`` parameter to ``/facts``, accepts ``json`` and ``csv``
* added ``fields=`` parameter to ``/facts`` - comma separated list of returned fields in CSV
* share single sqlalchemy engine within server thread
* limit number of facts returned in JSON (configurable by ``json_record_limit`` in ``[server]`` section)

Experimental:
(might change or be removed, use with caution)

* added cubes searching frontend for separate cubes_search experimenal Sphinx backend (see
  https://bitbucket.org/Stiivi/cubes-search)

Fixes
-----

* fixed localization bug in fact(s) - now uses proper attribute name without locale suffix
* fixed passing of pagination and ordering parameters from server to aggregation browser when
  requesting facts
* fixed bug when using multiple conditions in SQL aggregator
* make host/port optional separately
