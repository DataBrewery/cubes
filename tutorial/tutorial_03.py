# In this tutorial you are going to learn how to create a model file and use hierarchies. 
# The example shows:
# 
# * how hierarhies work
# * drill-down through a hierarchy
#
# The example data used are IBRD Balance Sheet taken from The World Bank
# Source: https://raw.github.com/Stiivi/cubes/master/tutorial/data/IBRD_Balance_Sheet__FY2010.csv
# 
# The source data file is manually modified for this tutorial: column "Line Item" is split into two:
# Subcategory and Line Item
#
# Create a tutorial directory and download the file:

# 1. Prepare SQL data in memory
