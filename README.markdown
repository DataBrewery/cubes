About
-----

Cubes is a light-weight Python framework and set of tools for Online
Analytical Processing (OLAP), multidimensional analysis and browsing of
aggregated data. 

*Focus on data analysis, in human way*

Purpose is to provide a framework for giving analyst or any application 
end-user understandable and natural way of presenting the multidimensional 
data. One of the main features is the logical model, which serves as 
abstraction over physical data to provide end-user layer.

Features:

* OLAP and aggregated browsing (default backend is for relational databse - 
  ROLAP)
* multidimensional analysis
* logical view of analysed data - how analysts look at data, how they think of
  data, not not how the data are physically implemented in the data stores
* hierarchical dimensions (attributes that have hierarchical dependencies,
  such as category-subcategory or country-region)
* localizable metadata and data
* OLAP server (WSGI HTTP server with JSON API based on Wergzeug)
