"""Dimension Browser example

A Flask application for browsing cube's dimensions.

Requirements: run ``python prepare_data.py`` in ``../hello_world``.

Use::
    python application.py

Then navigate your browser to: ``http://localhost:5000``

You can also access the Slicer at ``http://localhost:5000/slicer``.
