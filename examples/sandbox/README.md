Cubes Examples Sandbox
======================

This directory contains examples that are work in progress. They serve for
educational purposes, however they might not be very well documented yet. Once
a sandbox example is tuned, simplified enough to be understandable and
documented, then it will be moved to the parent `examples` directory.

These examples also serve for tuning usability of cubes. If they are not
understandable, then some work is necessary on the framework side.

If you have any example that you would like to include here, just write to the
author <stefan.urbanek@gmail.com> or better - send a pull request with files
to this directory.

Examples
--------

* `flask_dimension_browser` - simple Flask (web microframework) application
  for browsing a dimension hierarchy
