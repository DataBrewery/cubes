Content related keys:

* ``label`` – server's name or label
* ``description`` – description of the served data
* ``copyright`` – copyright of the data, if any
* ``license`` – data license
* ``maintainer`` – name of the data maintainer, might be in format ``Name

Example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "description": "Some Open Data",
        "license": "Public Domain",
        "keywords": ["budget", "financial"],
        "authentication": "none", 
        "json_record_limit": 1000, 
        "cubes_version": "0.11.2"
    }

Model
=====

List of Cubes
-------------

Request: ``GET /cubes``

Get list of basic information about served cubes. The cube description
dictionaries contain keys: `name`, `label`, `description` and `category`.

.. code-block:: javascript

    [
        {
            "name": "contracts",
            "label": "Contracts",
            "description": "...",
            "category": "..."
        }
    ]

Cube Model
----------

Request: ``GET /cube/<name>/model``

Get model of a cube `name`. Returned structure is a dictionary with keys:

* ``name`` – cube name – used as server-wide cube identifier
* ``label`` – human readable name of the cube – to be displayed to the users
  (localized)
* ``description`` – optional textual cube description (localized)
* ``dimensions`` – list of dimension description dictionaries (see below)
* ``aggregates`` – list of measures aggregates (mostly computed values) that
    can be computed. Each item is a dictionary. 
* ``measures`` – list of measure attributes (properties of facts). Each
    item is a dictionary. Example of a measure is: `amount`, `price`.
* ``details`` – list of attributes that contain fact details. Those attributes
  are provided only when getting a fact or a list of facts. 
* ``info`` – a dictionary with additional metadata that can be used in the
    front-end. The contents of this dictionary is defined by the model
    creator and interpretation of values is left to the consumer.
* ``features`` (advanced) – a dictionary with features of the browser, such as
  available actions for the cube ("is fact listing possible?")

Aggregate is the key numerical property of the cube from reporting
perspective. It is described as a dictionary with keys:

* ``name`` – aggregate identifier, such as: `amount_sum`, `price_avg`,
  `total`, `record_count`
* ``label`` – human readable label to be displayed (localized)
* ``measure`` – measure the aggregate is derived from, if it exists or it is
  known. Might be empty.
* ``function`` - name of an aggregate function applied to the `measure`, if
  known. For example: `sum`, `min`, `max`.
* ``window_size`` – number of elements within a window for window functions
  such as moving average
* ``info`` – additional custom information (unspecified)

Aggregate names are used in the ``aggregates`` parameter of the ``/aggregate``
request.

Measure dictionary contains:

* ``name`` – measure identifier
* ``label`` – human readable name to be displayed (localized)
* ``aggregates`` – list of aggregate functions that are provided for this
  measure
* ``window_size`` – number of elements within a window for window functions
  such as moving average
* ``info`` – additional custom information (unspecified)


.. note::

    Compared to previous versions of Cubes, the clients do not have to
    construct aggregate names (as it used to be ``amount``+``_sum``). Clients
    just get the aggrergate ``name`` property and use it right away.

See more information about measures and aggregates in the ``/aggregate``
request description.
    
Example cube:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "name": "contracts", 
        "info": {}, 
        "label": "Contracts", 
        "aggregates": [
            {
                "name": "amount_sum", 
                "label": "Amount sum", 
                "info": {}, 
                "function": "sum"
            }, 
            {
                "name": "record_count", 
                "label": "Record count", 
                "info": {}, 
                "function": "count"
            }
        ], 

        "measures": [
            {
                "name": "amount", 
                "label": "Amount", 
                "info": {}, 
                "aggregates": [ "sum" ]
            }
        ], 
        
        "details": [...],

        "dimensions": [...]
    }

The dimension description dictionary:

* ``name`` – dimension identifier
* ``label`` – human readable dimension name (localized)
* ``is_flat`` – `True` if the dimension has only one level, otherwise `False`
* ``has_details`` – `True` if the dimension has more than one attribute
* ``default_hierarchy_name`` - name of default dimension hierarchy
* ``levels`` – list of level descriptions
* ``hierarchies`` – list of dimension hierarchies
* ``info`` – additional custom information (unspecified)
* ``cardinality`` – dimension cardinality
* ``role`` – dimension role (special treatment, for example ``time``)
* ``category`` – dimension category

The level description:

* ``name`` – level identifier (within dimension context)
* ``label`` – human readable level name (localized)
* ``attributes`` – list of level's attributes
* ``key`` – name of level's key attribute (mostly the first attribute)
* ``label_attribute`` – name of an attribute that contains label for the
  level's members (mostly the second attribute, if present)
* ``order_attribute`` – name of an attribute that the level should be ordered
  by (optional)
* ``order`` – order direction ``asc``, ``desc`` or none.
* ``cardinality`` – symbolic approximation of the number of level's members
* ``role`` – level role (special treatment)
* ``info`` – additional custom information (unspecified)

Cardinality values and their meaning:

* ``tiny`` – few values, each value can have it's representation on the
  screen, recommended: up to 5.
* ``low`` – can be used in a list UI element, recommended 5 to 50 (if sorted)
* ``medium`` – UI element is a search/text field, recommended for more than 50
  elements
* ``high`` – backends might refuse to yield results without explicit
  pagination or cut through this level.

.. note::

    Use ``attribute["ref"]`` to access aggreegation result records.  Each
    level (dimension) attribute description contains two properties: `name`
    and `ref`.  `name` is identifier within the dimension context. The key
    reference `ref` is used for retrieving aggregation or browing results. 

    It is not recommended to create any dependency by parsing or constructing
    the `ref` property at the client's side.


Aggregation and Browsing
========================

The core data and analytical functionality is accessed through the following
requests:

* ``/cube/<name>/aggregate`` – aggregate measures, provide summary, generate
  drill-down, slice&dice, ...
* ``/cube/<name>/members/<dim>`` – list dimension members
* ``/cube/<name>/facts`` – list facts within a cell
* ``/cube/<name>/fact`` – return a single fact
* ``/cube/<name>/cell`` – describe the cell

If the model contains only one cube or default cube name is specified in the
configuration, then the ``/cube/<name>`` part might be omitted and you can
write only requests like ``/aggregate``.


Cells and Cuts
--------------

The cell - part of the cube we are aggregating or we are interested in - is
specified by cuts. The cut in URL are given as single parameter ``cut`` which
has following format:

Examples::

    date:2004
    date:2004,1
    date:2004,1|class:5
    date:2004,1,1|category:5,10,12|class:5

To specify a range where keys are sortable::

    date:2004-2005
    date:2004,1-2005,5

Open range::

    date:2004,1,1-
    date:-2005,5,10

Set cuts::

    date:2005;2007

Dimension name is followed by colon ``:``, each dimension cut is separated by
``|``, and path for dimension levels is separated by a comma ``,``. Set cuts are
separated by semicolons ``;``. 

To specify other than default hierarchy use format `dimension@hierarchy`, the
path then should contain values for specified hierarchy levels::

    date@ywd:2004,25

Following image contains examples of cuts in URLs and how they change by
browsing cube aggregates:

.. figure:: url_cutting.png

    Example of how cuts in URL work and how they should be used in application
    view templates.


Special Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To pass reserved characters as a dimension member path value escape it with
the backslash ``\`` character:

* ``category:10\-24`` is a point cut for `category` with value ``10-24``, not
  a range cut
* ``city:Nové\ Mesto\ nad\ Váhom`` is a city ``Nové Mesto nad Váhom``


.. _named_relative_time:

Calendar and Relative Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a dimension is a date or time dimension (the dimension role is ``time``)
the members can be specified by a name referring to a relative time. For
example:

* ``date:yesterday``
* ``date:90daysago-today`` – get cell for last 90 days
* ``expiration_date:lastmonth-next2months`` – all facts with `expiration
  date` within last month (whole) and next 2 months (whole)
* ``date:yearago`` – all facts since the same day of the year last year

The keywords and patterns are:

* ``today``, ``yesterday`` and ``tomorrow``
* ``...ago`` and ``...forward`` as in ``3weeksago`` (current day minus 3
  weeks) and ``2monthsforward`` (current day plus 2 months) – relative offset with fine granularity
* ``last...`` and ``next...`` as in ``last3months`` (beginning of the third
  month before current month) and ``nextyear`` (end of next year) –
  relative offset of specific (more coarse) granularity.

Aggregate
---------

.. _serveraggregate:

Request: ``GET /cube/<cube>/aggregate``

Return aggregation result as JSON. The result will contain keys: `summary`
and `drilldown`. The summary contains one row and represents aggregation
of whole cell specified in the cut. The `drilldown` contains rows for each
value of drilled-down dimension.

If no arguments are given, then whole cube is aggregated.

Parameters:

* `cut` - specification of cell, for example:
  ``cut=date:2004,1|category:2|entity:12345``
* `drilldown` - dimension to be drilled down. For example ``drilldown=date``
  will give rows for each value of next level of dimension date. You can
  explicitly specify level to drill down in form: ``dimension:level``, such
  as: ``drilldown=date:month``. To specify a hierarchy use
  ``dimension@hierarchy`` as in ``drilldown=date@ywd`` for implicit level or
  ``drilldown=date@ywd:week`` to explicitly specify level.
* `aggregates` – list of aggregates to be computed, separated by ``|``, for
  example: ``aggregates=amount_sum|discount_avg|count``
* `measures` – list of measures for which their respecive aggregates will be
  computed (see below). Separated by ``|``, for
  example: ``aggregates=proce|discount``
* `page` - page number for paginated results
* `pagesize` - size of a page for paginated results
* `order` - list of attributes to be ordered by
* `split` – split cell, same syntax as the `cut`, defines virtual binary
  (flag) dimension that inticates whether a cell belongs to the `split` cut
  (`true`) or not (`false`). The dimension attribute is called
  `__within_split__`. Consult the backend you are using for more information,
  whether this feature is supported or not.

.. note::

    You can specify either `aggregates` or `measures`. `aggregates` is a
    concrete list of computed values. `measures` yields their respective
    aggregates. For example: ``measures=amount`` might yield ``amount_sum``
    and ``amount_avg`` if defined in the model.
    
    Use of `aggregates` is preferred, as it is more explicit and the result
    is well defined.

..
    TODO: not implemented
    * `limit` - limit number of results in form
    `limit`[,`measure`[,`order_direction`]]: ``limit=5:received_amount_sum:asc``
    (this might not be implemented in all backends)

Response:

A dictionary with keys:

* ``summary`` - dictionary of fields/values for summary aggregation
* ``cells`` - list of drilled-down cells with aggregated results
* ``total_cell_count`` - number of total cells in drilldown (after `limit`,
  before pagination). This value might not be present if it is disabled for
  computation on the server side.
* ``aggregates`` – list of aggregate names that were considered in the
  aggragation query
* ``cell`` - list of dictionaries describing the cell cuts
* ``levels`` – a dictionary where keys are dimension names and values is a
  list of levels the dimension was drilled-down to

Example for request ``/aggregate?drilldown=date&cut=item:a``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "summary": {
            "count": 32, 
            "amount_sum": 558430
        }
        "cells": [
            {
                "count": 16, 
                "amount_sum": 275420, 
                "date.year": 2009
            }, 
            {
                "count": 16, 
                "amount_sum": 283010, 
                "date.year": 2010
            }
        ], 
        "aggregates": [
            "amount_sum", 
            "count"
        ], 
        "total_cell_count": 2, 
        "cell": [
            {
                "path": [ "a" ], 
                "type": "point", 
                "dimension": "item", 
                "invert": false,
                "level_depth": 1
            }
        ], 
        "levels": { "date": [ "year" ] }
    }


If pagination is used, then ``drilldown`` will not contain more than
``pagesize`` cells for a page. Pages start from 0 and ``page=0`` gives the first page.

Note that not all backengs might implement ``total_cell_count`` or
providing this information can be configurable therefore might be disabled
(for example for performance reasons).

Example for ``order``

``..aggregate?order=amount``

Default is ascending order you can specify ordering method by ``asc`` or ``desc`` as below.

``..aggregate?order=amount:desc``

Pagination and ordering can be collectively used to get top lists.

For example (Top five amounts)
``..aggregate?order=amount:desc&pagesize=5&page=0``

    

Facts
-----

Request: ``GET /cube/<cube>/facts``

Return all facts within a cell.

Parameters:

* `cut` - see ``/aggregate``
* `page`, `pagesize` - paginate results
* `order` - order results
* `format` - result format: ``json`` (default; see note below), ``csv`` or
  ``json_lines``.
* `fields` - comma separated list of fact fields, by default all fields are
  returned
* `header` – specify what kind of headers should be present in the ``csv``
  output: ``names`` – raw field names (default), ``labels`` – human readable labels or
  ``none``

The JSON response is a list of dictionaries where keys are attribute
references (`ref` property of an attribute).

To use JSON formatted repsonse but don't have the record limit ``json_lines``
format can be used. The result is one fact record in JSON format per line
– JSON dictionaries separated by newline `\n` character.

.. note::

    Number of facts in JSON is limited to configuration value of
    ``json_record_limit``, which is 1000 by default. To get more records,
    either use pages with size less than record limit or use alternate
    result format, such as ``csv``.
    
Single Fact
-----------

Request: ``GET /cube/<cube>/fact/<id>``

Get single fact with specified `id`. For example: ``/fact/1024``.

The response is a dictionary where keys are attribute references (`ref`
property of an attribute).
    
Dimension members
-----------------

Request: ``GET /cube/<cube>/members/<dimension>``

Get `dimension` members used in `cube`.

**Parameters:**

* `cut` - see ``/aggregate``
* `depth` - specify depth (number of levels) to retrieve. If not
    specified, then all levels are returned. Use this or `level`.
* `level` - deepest level to be retrieved – use this or `depth`.
* `hierarchy` – name of hierarchy to be considered, if not specified, then
    dimension's default hierarchy is used 
* `page`, `pagesize` - paginate results
* `order` - order results

**Response:** dictionary with keys ``dimension`` – dimension name,
``depth`` – level depth and ``data`` – list of records.

Example for ``/cube/facts/members/item?depth=1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "dimension": "item"
        "depth": 1, 
        "hierarchy": "default",
        "data": [
            {
                "item.category": "a", 
                "item.category_label": "Assets"
            }, 
            {
                "item.category": "e", 
                "item.category_label": "Equity"
            }, 
            {
                "item.category": "l", 
                "item.category_label": "Liabilities"
            }
        ], 
    }

Cell
----

Get details for a cell.

Request: ``GET /cube/<cube>/cell``


**Parameters:**

* `cut` - see ``/aggregate``

**Response:** a dictionary representation of a ``cell`` (see
:meth:`cubes.Cell.as_dict`) with keys ``cube`` and ``cuts``. `cube` is
cube name and ``cuts`` is a list of dictionary representations of cuts.

Each cut is represented as:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        // Cut type is one of: "point", "range" or "set"
        "type": cut_type,

        "dimension": cut_dimension_name,
        "level_depth": maximal_depth_of_the_cut,

        // Cut type specific keys.

        // Point cut:
        "path": [ ... ],
        "details": [ ... ]
        
        // Range cut:
        "from": [ ... ],
        "to": [ ... ],
        "details": { "from": [...], "to": [...] }
        
        // Set cut:
        "paths": [ [...], [...], ... ],
        "details": [ [...], [...], ... ]
    }
    
Each element of the ``details`` path contains dimension attributes for the
corresponding level. In addition in contains two more keys: ``_key`` and
``_label`` which (redundantly) contain values of key attribute and label
attribute respectively.

Example for ``/cell?cut=item:a`` in the ``hello_world`` example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "cube": "irbd_balance", 
        "cuts": [
            {
                "type": "point", 
                "dimension": "item", 
                "level_depth": 1
                "path": ["a"], 
                "details": [
                    {
                        "item.category": "a", 
                        "item.category_label": "Assets", 
                        "_key": "a", 
                        "_label": "Assets"
                    }
                ], 
            }
        ]
    }
        

.. _serverreport:

Report
------

Request: ``GET /cube/<cube>/report``

Process multiple request within one API call. The data should be a JSON
containing report specification where keys are names of queries and values
are dictionaries describing the queries.

``report`` expects ``Content-type`` header to be set to
``application/json``.

See :ref:`serverreport` for more information.

Search
------

.. warning::

    Experimental feature.

.. note::

    Requires a search backend to be installed.

Request: ``GET /cube/<cube>/search/dimension/<dimension>/<query>``

Search values of `dimensions` for `query`. If `dimension` is ``_all`` then
all dimensions are searched. Returns search results as list of
dictionaries with attributes:

:Search result:
    * `dimension` - dimension name
    * `level` - level name
    * `depth` - level depth
    * `level_key` - value of key attribute for level
    * `attribute` - dimension attribute name where searched value was found
    * `value` - value of dimension attribute that matches search query
    * `path` - dimension hierarchy path to the found value
    * `level_label` - label for dimension level (value of label_attribute
        for level)
    
Parameters that can be used in any request:

    * `prettyprint` - if set to ``true``, space indentation is added to the
      JSON output


Reports
=======

Report queries are done either by specifying a report name in the request URL
or using HTTP ``GET`` request where posted data are JSON with report
specification.

.. If report name is specified in ``GET`` request instead, then
.. server should have a repository of named report specifications.

Keys:

    * `queries` - dictionary of named queries

..    * `formatters` - dictionary of formatter configurations

Query specification should contain at least one key: `query` - which is query
type: ``aggregate``, ``cell_details``, ``values`` (for dimension
values), ``facts`` or ``fact`` (for multiple or single fact respectively). The
rest of keys are query dependent. For more information see AggregationBrowser
documentation.

.. note::

    Note that you have to set the content type to ``application/json``.

Result is a dictionary where keys are the query names specified in report
specification and values are result values from each query call.

Example report JSON file with two queries:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "queries": {
            "summary": {
                "query": "aggregate"
            },
            "by_year": {
                "query": "aggregate",
                "drilldown": ["date"],
                "rollup": "date"
            }
        }
    }

Request::

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary "@report.json" \
        "http://localhost:5000/cube/contracts/report?prettyprint=true&cut=date:2004"

Explicit specification of a cell (the cuts in the URL parameters are going to
be ignored):

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "cell": [
            {
                "dimension": "date",
                "type": "range",
                "from": [2010,9],
                "to": [2011,9]
            }
        ],
        "queries": {
            "report": {
                "query": "aggregate",
                "drilldown": {"date":"year"}
            }
        }
    }

Roll-up
-------

Report queries might contain ``rollup`` specification which will result in
"rolling-up" one or more dimensions to desired level. This functionality is
provided for cases when you would like to report at higher level of
aggregation than the cell you provided is in. It works in similar way as drill
down in ``/aggregate`` but in the opposite direction (it is like ``cd ..`` in
a UNIX shell).

Example: You are reporting for year 2010, but you want to have a bar chart
with all years. You specify rollup:

.. code-block:: javascript

    ...
    "rollup": "date",
    ...

Roll-up can be:

    * a string - single dimension to be rolled up one level
    * an array - list of dimension names to be rolled-up one level
    * a dictionary where keys are dimension names and values are levels to be
      rolled up-to

Local Server
------------

To run your local server, prepare server :doc:`configuration` and run the
server using the Slicer tool (see :doc:`/slicer`)::

    slicer serve slicer.ini

Server requests
---------------

Example server request to get aggregate for whole cube::

    $ curl http://localhost:5000/cube/procurements/aggregate?cut=date:2004
