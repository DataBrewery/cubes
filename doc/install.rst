There are two options how to install cubes: basic common installation - 
recommended mostly for users starting with Cubes. Then there is customized 
installation with requirements explained.

Dependencies:

* `SQLAlchemy`_
* `expressions`
* `python-dateutil`

Basic Installation
==================

The cubes has optional requirements:

* `Flask`_ for Slicer OLAP HTTP server

.. note::

    If you never used Python before, you might have to get the `pip installer`_ 
    first, if you do not have it already.
    
.. note::

    The command-line tool :doc:`Slicer<slicer>` does not require knowledge of 
    Python. You do not need to know the language if you just want to 
    :doc:`serve<server>` OLAP data.

You may install Cubes with the minimal dependencies, ::

    pip install cubes

with certain extras (html, sql, mongo, or slicer), ::

    pip install cubes[slicer]

or with all of the extras. ::

    pip install cubes[all]

If you are developing cubes, you should install ``cubes[all]``.
