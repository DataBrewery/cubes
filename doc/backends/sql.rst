***********
SQL Backend
***********

The SQL backend is using the `SQLAlchemy`_ which supports following SQL database
dialects:

* Drizzle
* Firebird
* Informix
* Microsoft SQL Server
* MySQL
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* Sybase

.. _SQLAlchemy: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html


Supported aggregate functions:

* `sum`
* `count` – equivalend to ``COUNT(1)``
* `count_nonempty` – equivalent to ``COUNT(measure)``
* `count_distinct` – equivalent to ``COUNT(DISTINCT measure)``
* `min`
* `max`
* `avg`
* `stddev`
* `variance`

Store Configuration
===================

Data store:

* ``url`` *(required)* – database URL in form: 
  ``adapter://user:password@host:port/database``, for example:
  ``postgresql://stefan:secret@localhost:5432/datawarehouse``. Empty values
  can be ommited, as in ``postgresql://localhost/datawarehouse``.
* ``schema`` *(optional)* – schema containing denormalized views for
  relational DB cubes


Database Connection
-------------------

*(advanced topic)*

To fine-tune the SQLAlchemy database connection some of the `create_engine()`
parameters can be specified as ``sqlalchemy_PARAMETER``:

* ``sqlalchemy_case_sensitive``
* ``sqlalchemy_convert_unicode``
* ``sqlalchemy_pool_size``
* ``sqlalchemy_pool_recycle``
* ``sqlalchemy_pool_timeout``
* ``sqlalchemy_...`` ...

Please refer to the create_engine_ documentation for more information.

.. _create_engine: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/core/engines.html?highlight=engine#sqlalchemy.create_engine

Naming
======

The following configuration settings might be used in the naming conventions
configuration:

* ``dimension_prefix`` *(optional)* – used by snowflake mapper to find
  dimension tables when no explicit mapping is specified
* ``dimension_suffix`` *(optional)* – used by snowflake mapper to find
  dimension tables when no explicit mapping is specified
* ``dimension_schema`` – use this option when dimension tables are stored in
  different schema than the fact tables
* ``fact_prefix`` *(optional)* – used by the snowflake mapper to find fact
  table for a cube, when no explicit fact table name is specified
* ``fact_suffix`` *(optional)* – used by the snowflake mapper to find fact
  table for a cube, when no explicit fact table name is specified
* ``use_denormalization`` *(optional)* – browser will use dernormalized view
  instead of snowflake
* ``denormalized_view_prefix`` *(optional, advanced)* – if denormalization is
  used, then this prefix is added for cube name to find corresponding cube
  view
* ``denormalized_view_schema`` *(optional, advanced)* – schema wehere
  denormalized views are located (use this if the views are in different
  schema than fact tables, otherwise default schema is going to be used)


Model Requirements
==================

Cube has to have ``key`` property set to the fact table key column to be able
to provide list of facts. Default key is ``id``.


Mappings
========

One of the important parts of proper OLAP on top of the relational database is
the mapping of logical attributes to their physical counterparts.  In SQL
database the physical attribute is stored in a column, which belongs to a
table, which might be part of a database schema.

.. figure:: ../images/mapping_logical_to_physical.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400px

For example, take a reference to an attribute *name* in a dimension *product*.
What is the column of what table in which schema that contains the value of
this dimension attribute?

.. figure:: ../images/mapping-example1.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400px

For data browsing, the Cubes framework has to know where those logical
(reported) attributes are physically stored. It needs to know which tables are
related to the cube and how they are joined together so we get whole view of a
fact.

The process is done in two steps:

1. joining relevant star/snowflake tables
2. mapping logical attribute to table + column

There are two ways how the mapping is being done: *implicit* and *explicit*.
The simplest, straightforward and most customizable is the explicit way, where
the actual column reference is provided in a mapping dictionary of the cube
description.

Implicit Mapping
----------------

With implicit mapping one can match a database schema with logical model and
does not have to specify additional mapping metadata. Expected structure is
star schema with one table per (denormalized) dimension.

Facts
^^^^^

Cubes looks for fact table with the same name as cube name.  You might specify
prefix for every fact table with ``fact_table_prefix``.  Example:

* Cube is named `contracts`, framework looks for a table named `contracts`.

* Cubes are named `contracts`, `invoices` and fact table prefix is ``fact_``
  then framework looks for tables named ``fact_contracts`` and
  ``fact_invoices`` respectively.

Dimensions
^^^^^^^^^^

*In short:* a dimension attribute `customer.name` maps to table `customer` and
column `name` by default. A dimension without details and with just a single
level such as `is_hungry` maps to the `is_hungry` column of the fact table.

By default, dimension tables are expected to have same name as dimensions and
dimension table columns are expected to have same name as dimension
attributes:

.. figure:: ../images/dimension_attribute_implicit_map.png
    :align: center

It is quite common practice that dimension tables have a prefix such as
``dim_`` or ``dm_``. Such prefix can be specified with ``dimension_prefix``
option.

.. figure:: ../images/dimension_attribute_prefix_map.png
    :align: center

The rules are:

* fact table should have same name as represented cube: `fact table name` =
  `fact table prefix` + `fact table name`
* dimension table should have same name as the represented dimension, for
  example: `product` (singular):
  `dimension table name` = `dimension prefix` + `dimension name`
* column name should have same name as dimension attribute: `name`, `code`,
  `description`
* references without dimension name in them are expected to be in the fact
  table, for example: `amount`, `discount` (see note below for simple flat
  dimensions)
* if attribute is localized, then there should be one column per localization
  and should have locale suffix: `description_en`, `description_sk`,
  `description_fr` (see below for more information)

Flat dimension without details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What about dimensions that have only one attribute, like one would not have a
full date but just a `year`? In this case it is kept in the fact table without
need of separate dimension table. The attribute is treated in by the same rule
as measure and is referenced by simple `year`. This is applied to all
dimensions that have only one attribute (representing key as well). This
dimension is referred to as *flat and without details*.

.. note::

    The simplification of the flat references can be disabled by setting
    ``simplify_dimension_references`` to ``False`` in the mapper. In that case
    you will have to have separate table for the dimension attribute and you
    will have to reference the attribute by full name. This might be useful
    when you know that your dimension will be more detailed.

Database Schemas
----------------

For databases that support schemas, such as PostgreSQL, option ``schema`` can
be used to specify default database schema where all tables are going to be
looked for.

In case you have dimensions stored in separate schema than fact table, you can
specify that in ``dimension_schema``. All dimension tables are going to be
searched in that schema.

.. _explicit_mapping:

Explicit Mapping
----------------

If the schema does not match expectations of cubes, it is possible to
explicitly specify how logical attributes are going to be mapped to their
physical tables and columns. `Mapping dictionary` is a dictionary of logical
attributes as keys and physical attributes (columns, fields) as values. The
logical attributes references look like:

* `dimensions_name.attribute_name`, for example: ``geography.country_name`` or 
  ``category.code``
* `fact_attribute_name`, for example: ``amount`` or ``discount``

Following mapping maps attribute `name` of dimension `product` to the column
`product_name` of table `dm_products`.

.. code-block:: javascript

    "mappings": {
        "product.name": "dm_products.product_name"
    }

.. note::

    Note that in the mappings the table names should be spelled as they are in
    the database even the table prefix is specified.

If it is in different schema or any part of the reference contains a dot:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "mappings": {
        "product.name": {
                "schema": "sales",
                "table": "dm_products",
                "column": "product_name"
            }
    }


Both, explicit and implicit mappings have ability to specify default database
schema (if you are using Oracle, PostgreSQL or any other DB which supports
schemas).

The mapping process process is like this:

.. figure:: ../images/mapping-overview.png
    :align: center
    :width: 500px
    
Date Data Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date datatype column can be turned into a date dimension by extracting date
parts in the mapping. To do so, for each date attribute specify a ``column``
name and part to be extracted with value for ``extract`` key.

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    "mappings": {
      "date.year": {"column":"date", "extract":"year"},
      "date.month": {"column":"date", "extract":"month"},
      "date.day": {"column":"date", "extract":"day"}
    }

According to SQLAlchemy, you can extract in most of the databases: ``month``,
``day``, ``year``, ``second``, ``hour``, ``doy`` (day of the year),
``minute``, ``quarter``, ``dow`` (day of the week), ``week``, ``epoch``,
``milliseconds``, ``microseconds``, ``timezone_hour``, ``timezone_minute``.
Please refer to your database engine documentation for more information.

.. note::

    It is still recommended to have a date dimension table.

Localization
------------

From physical point of view, the data localization is very trivial and
requires language denormalization - that means that each language has to have
its own column for each attribute.

Localizable attributes are those attributes that have ``locales`` specified in
their definition. To map logical attributes which are localizable, use locale
suffix for each locale. For example attribute `name` in dimension `category`
has two locales: Slovak (``sk``) and English (``en``). Or for example product
category can be in English, Slovak or German. It is specified in the model
like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    attributes = [
        {
            "name" = "category",
            "locales" = ["en", "sk", "de"]
        }
    ]

During the mapping process, localized logical reference is created first:

.. figure:: ../images/mapping-to_localized.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600px

In short: if attribute is localizable and locale is requested, then locale
suffix is added. If no such localization exists then default locale is used.
Nothing happens to non-localizable attributes.

For such attribute, three columns should exist in the physical model. There
are two ways how the columns should be named. They should have attribute name
with locale suffix such as ``category_sk`` and ``category_en`` (_underscore_
because it is more common in table column names), if implicit mapping is used.
You can name the columns as you like, but you have to provide explicit mapping
in the mapping dictionary. The key for the localized logical attribute should
have ``.locale`` suffix, such as ``product.category.sk`` for Slovak version of
category attribute of dimension product. Here the _dot_ is used because dots
separate logical reference parts.

.. note::

    Current implementation of Cubes framework requires a star or snowflake
    schema that can be joined into fully denormalized normalized form just by
    simple one-key based joins. Therefore all localized attributes have to be
    stored in their own columns. In other words, you have to denormalize the
    localized data before using them in Cubes.

Read more about :doc:`../localization`.

  
Mapping Process Summary
-----------------------

Following diagram describes how the mapping of logical to physical attributes
is done in the star SQL browser (see :class:`cubes.backends.sql.StarBrowser`):

.. figure:: ../images/mapping-logical_to_physical.png
    :align: center

    logical to physical attribute mapping

The "red path" shows the most common scenario where defaults are used.

Joins
=====

The SQL backend supports a star:

.. figure:: ../images/schema_star.png
    :align: center
    :width: 300px

and a snowflake database schema:

.. figure:: ../images/schema_snowflake.png
    :align: center
    :width: 300px

If you are using either of the two schemas (star or snowflake) in relational
database, Cubes requires information on how to join the tables. Tables are
joined by matching single-column – surrogate keys. The framework needs the
join information to be able to transform following snowflake:

.. figure:: ../images/snowflake_schema.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400px

to appear as a denormalized table with all cube attributes:

.. figure:: ../images/denormalized_schema.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400px

.. note::

    The SQL backend performs only joins that are relevant to the given query.
    If no attributes from a table are used, then the table is not joined.


Join Description
----------------

Joins are defined as an ordered list (order is important) for every cube
separately. The join description consists of reference to the `master` table
and a table with `details`. Fact table is example of master table, dimension
is example of a detail table (in a star schema).

The join specification is very simple, you define column reference for both:
master and detail. The table reference is in the form `table`.`column`:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "joins" = [
        {
            "master": "fact_sales.product_key",
            "detail": "dim_product.key"
        }
    ]

As in mappings, if you have specific needs for explicitly mentioning database
schema or any other reason where `table.column` reference is not enough, you
might write:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "joins" = [
        { 
            "master": "fact_sales.product_id",
            "detail": {
                "schema": "sales",
                "table": "dim_products",
                "column": "id"
            }
    ]


To specify a compound join key, the ``column`` value of a join specified as a
dictionary can be an array denoting multiple keys. The above join would be
specified as:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "master": {
            "table": "fact_table",
            "column": ["dimension_id", "partition"]
        },
        "detail": {
            "table": "dimension",
            "column": ["id", "partition"]
        }
    }

This will generate the following join:

.. code-block:: sql

    FROM fact_table
    INNER JOIN fact_table ON (
       fact_table.dimension_id = dimension_table.id  
      AND fact_table.partition = dimension.partition
    )


Join Order
----------

Order of joins has to be from the master tables towards the details.

Aliases
-------

What if you need to join same table twice or more times? For example, you have
list of organizations and you want to use it as both: supplier and service
consumer.

.. figure:: ../images/joins-in_physical.png
    :align: center
    :width: 500px

It can be done by specifying alias in the joins:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "joins" = [
        {
            "master": "contracts.supplier_id", 
            "detail": "organisations.id",
            "alias": "suppliers"
        },
        {
            "master": "contracts.consumer_id", 
            "detail": "organisations.id",
            "alias": "consumers"
        }
    ]

Note that with aliases, in the mappings you refer to the table by alias
specified in the joins, not by real table name. So after aliasing tables with
previous join specification, the mapping should look like:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "mappings": {
        "supplier.name": "suppliers.org_name",
        "consumer.name": "consumers.org_name"
    }

For example, we have a fact table named ``fact_contracts`` and dimension table 
with categories named ``dm_categories``. To join them we define following join 
specification:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "joins" = [
        {
            "master": "fact_contracts.category_id",
            "detail": "dm_categories.id"
         }
    ]

.. _sql-outer-joins:

Join Methods and Outer Joins
----------------------------

*(advanced topic)*

Cubes supports three join methods ``match``, ``detail`` and ``master``.

`match` (default) – the keys from both master and detail tables have to match
– INNER JOIN

.. figure:: ../images/cubes-sql_joins-match.png
    :align: center
    :width: 300px

`master` – the master might contain more keys than the detail, for example the
fact table (as a master) might contain unknown or new dimension entries not in
the dimension table yet. This is also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN.

.. figure:: ../images/cubes-sql_joins-master.png
    :align: center
    :width: 300px

`detail` – every member of the detail table will be always present. For
example every date from a date dimension table. Alskoknown as RIGHT OUTER
JOIN.

.. figure:: ../images/cubes-sql_joins-detail.png
    :align: center
    :width: 300px

To join a date dimension table so that every date will be present in the
output reports, regardless whether there are any facts or not for given
date dimension member:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "joins" = [
        {
            "master": "fact_contracts.contract_date_id",
            "detail": "dim_date.id",
            "method": "detail"
         }
    ]

The `detail` Method and its Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*(advanced topic)*

When at least one table is joined using the outer `detail` method during
aggregation, the statement is composed from two nested statements or two join
zones: `master fact` and `outer detail`.

.. figure:: ../images/cubes-outer_join_aggregate_statement.png
    :align: center
    :width: 500px

    Aggregate statement composition

The query builder analyses the schema and assigns a relationship of a table
towards the fact. If a table is joined as `detail` or is behind a `detail`
join it is considered to have a `detail` relationship towards the fact.
Otherwise it has `master/match` relationship. 

When this composed setting is used, then:

* aggregate functions are wrapped using ``COALESCE()`` to always return
  non-NULL values
* ``count`` aggregates are changed to count non-empty facts instead of all
  rows

.. note::

    There should be no cut (path) that has some attributes in tables joined as
    `master` and others in a table joined as `detail`. Every cut (all the
    cut's attributes) should fall into one of the two table zones: either the
    master or the outer detail. There might be cuts from different join zones,
    though.

    Take this into account when designing the dimension hierarchies.

Named Join Templates
--------------------

If multiple cubes share the same kinds of joins, for example with a dimension
table, it is possible to define such joins at the model level. They will be
considered as templates:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "joins": [
        { "name": "date", "detail": "dim_date.id" },
        { "name": "company", "detail": "dim_company.id" }
    ]

Then use the join in a cube:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "cubes": [
        {
            "name": "events",
            "joins": [
                { "name": "date", "master": "event_date_id" },
                { "name": "company", "master": "company_id" }
            ]
        }
    ]

Any property defined in the cube join will replace the model join template.
You can also use the same named join multiple times in a cube, just give it
different alias:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "cubes": [
        {
            "name": "contracts",
            "joins": [
                {
                    "name": "date",
                    "master": "contract_start_date_id",
                    "alias": "dim_contract_start"
                },
                {
                    "name": "date",
                    "master": "contract_end_date_id",
                    "alias": "dim_contract_end"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
