class Cube(ModelObject):
    """Logical representation of a cube.

    Properties:

    * `name`: cube name, used as identifier
    * `measures`: list of measures – numerical attributes
      aggregation functions or natively aggregated values
    * `label`: human readable cube label
    * `details`: list of detail attributes
    * `description` - human readable description of the cube
    * `key`: fact key field (if not specified, then backend default key
      will be used, mostly ``id`` for SLQ or ``_id`` for document based
      databases)
    * `info` - custom information dictionary, might be used to store
      application/front-end specific information
    * `locale`: cube's locale
    * `dimension_links` – dimensions to be linked after the cube is
      created

    There are two ways how to assign dimensions to the cube: specify them
    during cube initialization in `dimensions` by providing a list of
    `Dimension` objects. Alternatively you can set `dimension_links`
    list with dimension names and the link the dimension using
    :meth:`cubes.Cube.link_dimension()`.

    Physical properties of the cube are described in the following
    attributes. They are used by the backends:

    * `mappings` - backend-specific logical to physical mapping
      dictionary. Keys and values of this dictionary are interpreted by
      the backend.
    * `joins` - backend-specific join specification (used for example in
      the SQL backend). It should be a list of dictionaries.
    * `fact` - fact table (collection, dataset, ...) name
    * `store` - name of data store where the cube belongs
    * `browser_options` - dictionary of other options used by the backend
      - refer to the backend documentation to see what options are used
      (for example SQL browser might look here for ``denormalized_view``
      in case of denormalized browsing)


    The dimension links are either dimension names or dictionaries
    specifying how the dimension will be linked to the cube. The keys of
    the link dictionary are:

    * `name` – name of the dimension to be linked
    * `hierarchies` – list of hierarchy names to be kept from the
      dimension
    * `nonadditive` – additivity of the linked dimension (overrides the
      dimension's value)
    * `cardinality` – cardinality of the linked dimension in the cube's
      context (overrides the dimension's value)
    * `default_hierarchy_name` – which hierarchy will be used as default
      in the linked dimension
