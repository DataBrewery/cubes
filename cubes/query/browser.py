        `month` and `day` levels are added.

        raised. Say your model has three levels of the `date` dimension:

        level then ``ValueError`` will be raised.

        cell ``cell`` (for cell details). Rest of values are function
        specific, please refer to the respective function documentation for
        more information.

        drill-down by transaction type.

        Raises `cubes.ArgumentError` when there are no queries specified

        .. (arbitrary) and values are formatter instances.

        *Roll-up*

        Report queries might contain ``rollup`` specification which will
        result in "rolling-up" one or more dimensions to desired level. This
        functionality is provided for cases when you would like to report at
        higher level of aggregation than the cell you provided is in. It works
        in similar way as drill down in :meth:`AggregationBrowser.aggregate`
        but in the opposite direction (it is like ``cd ..`` in a UNIX shell).

        Example: You are reporting for year 2010, but you want to have a bar
        chart with all years. You specify rollup::

            ...
            "rollup": "date",
            ...

        Roll-up can be:

            * a string - single dimension to be rolled up one level
            * an array - list of dimension names to be rolled-up one level
            * a dictionary where keys are dimension names and values are
              levels to be rolled up-to

        *Future*

        In the future there might be optimisations added to this method,
        therefore it will become faster than subsequent separate requests.
        Also when used with Slicer OLAP service server number of HTTP call
        overhead is reduced.

    level of hierarachy.

    down.
