        then you specify ``drilldown = ["date"]``.

        name and value is last level to be drilled-down by. If the cell is at

        `month` and `day` levels are added.

        raised. Say your model has three levels of the `date` dimension:
        `year`, `month`, `day` and you try to drill down by `date` at the next
        level then ``ValueError`` will be raised.

        Retruns a :class:`AggregationResult` object.

        If `split` is specified, then virtual dimension named
        `__within_split__` will be created and will contain `true` value if
        the cell is within the split cell and `false` if the cell is outside
        of the split.

        """Bundle multiple requests from `queries` into a single one.

        Keys of `queries` are custom names of queries which caller can later
        use to retrieve respective query result. Values are dictionaries
        specifying arguments of the particular query. Each query should
        contain at least one required value ``query`` which contains name of
        the query function: ``aggregate``, ``facts``, ``fact``, ``values`` and
        cell ``cell`` (for cell details). Rest of values are function
        specific, please refer to the respective function documentation for
        more information.

        Example::

            queries = {
                "product_summary" = { "query": "aggregate",
                                      "drilldown": "product" }
                "year_list" = { "query": "values",
                                "dimension": "date",
                                "depth": 1 }
            }

        Result is a dictionary where keys wil lbe the query names specified in
        report specification and values will be result values from each query
        call.::

            result = browser.report(cell, queries)
            product_summary = result["product_summary"]
            year_list = result["year_list"]

        This method provides convenient way to perform multiple common queries
        at once, for example you might want to have always on a page: total
        transaction count, total transaction amount, drill-down by year and
        drill-down by transaction type.

        Raises `cubes.ArgumentError` when there are no queries specified
        or if a query is of unknown type.

        .. `formatters` is a dictionary where keys are formatter names
        .. (arbitrary) and values are formatter instances.

        *Roll-up*

        Report queries might contain ``rollup`` specification which will
        result in "rolling-up" one or more dimensions to desired level. This
        functionality is provided for cases when you would like to report at
        higher level of aggregation than the cell you provided is in. It works
        in similar way as drill down in :meth:`AggregationBrowser.aggregate`
        but in the opposite direction (it is like ``cd ..`` in a UNIX shell).

        Example: You are reporting for year 2010, but you want to have a bar
        chart with all years. You specify rollup::

            ...
            "rollup": "date",
            ...

        Roll-up can be:

            * a string - single dimension to be rolled up one level
            * an array - list of dimension names to be rolled-up one level
            * a dictionary where keys are dimension names and values are
              levels to be rolled up-to

        *Future*

        In the future there might be optimisations added to this method,
        therefore it will become faster than subsequent separate requests.
        Also when used with Slicer OLAP service server number of HTTP call
        overhead is reduced.
