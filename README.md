Cubes is a light-weight Python framework and set of tools for Online
Analytical Processing (OLAP), multidimensional analysis and browsing of
aggregated data. 

*Focus on data analysis, in human way*

Overview
========

Purpose is to provide a framework for giving analyst or any application 
end-user understandable and natural way of presenting the multidimensional 
data. One of the main features is the logical model, which serves as 
abstraction over physical data to provide end-user layer.

Features:

* OLAP and aggregated browsing (default backend is for relational databse - 
  ROLAP)
* multidimensional analysis
* logical view of analysed data - how analysts look at data, how they think of
  data, not not how the data are physically implemented in the data stores
* hierarchical dimensions (attributes that have hierarchical dependencies,
  such as category-subcategory or country-region)
* localizable metadata and data
* SQL query generator for multidimensional aggregation queries
* OLAP server â€“ HTTP server based on Flask Blueprint, can be [easily
  integrated](http://pythonhosted.org/cubes/deployment.html) into your
  application.

Documentation
=============

Latest release documentation: http://packages.python.org/cubes

Development documentation: http://cubes.databrewery.org/dev/doc

Examples
--------

See `examples` directory in the source code repository
for simple examples and use-cases.

See https://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes-examples
for more complex examples.

Models
------

For cubes models see
https://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes-models


Development
============
Source code is in a Git repository `on GitHub <https://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes>`_. ::

    git clone git://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes

After you've cloned, you might want to install all of the development dependencies. ::

    pip install -e .[dev]

Build the documentation like so. ::

    cd doc
    make help
    make html

Outputs will go in ``doc/_*``.

Requirements
------------

Python >= 2.7 and Python >= 3.4.1


Most of the requirements are soft (optional) and need to be satisfied only if 
certain parts of cubes are being used.

* SQLAlchemy from http://www.sqlalchemy.org/ version >= 0.7.4 - for SQL
  backend
* Werkzeug from http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/ for Slicer server
* Jinja2 from http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/ for HTML presenters
* PyMongo for mongo and mongo2 backend
* pytz for mongo2 backend

Support
=======

If you have questions, problems or suggestions, you can send a message to the 
[Google group cubes-discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/cubes-discuss).

IRC channel #databrewery on server irc.freenode.net

Report bugs using [github issue
tracking](https://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes/issues).


Development
-----------

If you are browsing the code and you find something that:

* is over-complicated or not obvious
* is redundant
* can be done in better Python-way

... please let it be known.
